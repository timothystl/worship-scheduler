  //   council — the governance tier (renamed from `office`): sees the Reports tab and giving
  //             only at the 'anon' level (totals, never donors). Finance is three independent
  //             items for every configurable role (see financeSegItems below): `finance` is the

  //             Property, Chart of Accounts, Data & Imports), `compensation` is the Compensation
  //             Planner, `budget` is the Budget/Planning tab. Council defaults to `finance`:
  //             'none', `compensation`: 'edit' — so out of the box a council member reaches only
  //             the Compensation Planner, and can save their own raise-plan toggles/percentages

  //             Ministry Roles / Events / Templates, all in api-admin.js); denied outright

  // without them — and finLoadPlanning()'s four reads (the church ledger/budget tree and its
  // sibling config) are one shared fetch behind Budget, Chart of Accounts AND the Compensation
  // Planner's own "current pay from this worker's budget line" lookups (see FIN_SECTION_LOADERS
  // in js-finance.js). Those payloads carry more than compensation (or budget) figures — the
  // Compensation tab filters its slice down to salary/benefit lines client-side rather than the

  // at all; that file's own PUT handler still only recognizes admin, the dedicated `compensation`
  // role and `council` by name for its write, so granting 'compensation':'edit' here to
  // finance/staff does not (yet) let them save it — it only affects what they can reach/see.
