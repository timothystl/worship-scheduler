## Staff experience

The architecture deliberately limits staff destinations:

| Work | Destination |
|---|---|
| Website, news, newsletters, public content | Website Admin |
| People, Giving, communication, volunteers, schedules, facilities, governance, HR | Connect |
| Accounting, budgets, payroll processing, finance reports | Finance |
| MDO work | myMDO |

Serve and Scheduler may become separately deployed services, but their management interfaces remain inside Connect.

## Physical-boundary guidance

- Finance should eventually align hostname, deployment, repository/package, and database ownership.
- Giving remains authoritative in Connect. Finance receives summarized, versioned projections.
- A Worker split without database ownership does not provide complete D1 attribution.
- myMDO stays on its Supabase boundary and is not folded into Connect.
- The Website stays independent of Connect and Finance availability.
- Repositories may contain multiple deployable packages while boundaries are established. Repository separation is performed only when deployment, security, data, and operational ownership justify it.

## Failure boundaries

- Finance failure must not block Connect People, Giving entry, Website editing, or Serve intake.
- Connect failure must not block Website publishing.
- Website failure must not corrupt Connect or myMDO records.
- myMDO remains functional when church systems are unavailable, except for explicitly optional integrations.
- Message-provider failure queues or reports messages; it does not block ordinary application work.
