# Repository Document Inventory

> **Architecture reference — not AI startup instructions.** `AGENTS.md` is the sole current

Status: Phase 0 structural triage; dispositions are provisional  
Captured: September 5, 2026

This register accounts for every Markdown file currently found in the three repositories. “Proposed disposition” is a starting hypothesis, not authorization to edit or delete the file. Content claims still require verification under the [Repository Documentation Reset](09-repository-documentation-reset.md).

Disposition meanings:

- **Retain** — preserve in the active tree, usually after validation.
- **Rewrite** — replace with a current canonical document serving the same durable purpose.
- **Merge** — extract verified facts into a canonical document, then remove the duplicate source.
- **Convert** — move unresolved work to the backlog or consequential decisions/incidents to ADRs/postmortems.
- **Remove** — delete from the active tree only after confirming no required information remains.
- **Security gate** — rotate/remediate first; ordinary deletion is insufficient.
- **Do not edit** — third-party or legal material.

## Immediate conclusions

- The active instruction set should become dramatically smaller, but deletion is not yet safe.
- The oversized `CLAUDE.md` files are inputs to the rewrite, not suitable long-term sources of truth.
- `chms/SECRETS.md` is the first security-sensitive documentation item and must follow the credential procedure.
- Manuals require staff validation; technical inspection alone cannot establish that they describe real workflows.
- Third-party licenses are outside the reset and remain untouched.
- Design handoffs, prompts, and completed fix/status documents are strong removal candidates only after requirements and unresolved work are accounted for.

## Next inventory pass

The next pass adds, for every row, the last responsible author/owner, claims requiring verification, conflicting documents, source or production evidence, final disposition, canonical destination, and approval. That pass occurs before any replacement commit.
