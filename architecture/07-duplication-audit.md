## Audit record template

For each row capture:

- business meaning;
- current physical tables/files/routes;
- authoritative owner and writer;
- readers;
- identifiers and correspondence rules;
- sensitivity and retention;
- whether each copy is authoritative, projection, cache, export, or accidental duplicate;
- integrations and failure behavior;
- current discrepancies;
- disposition: keep, project, migrate, archive, or retire;
- validation and rollback requirements.

Do not merge similarly named facts automatically. Website events, Serve opportunities, Scheduler services, gym bookings, and MDO closures are distinct unless the audit proves otherwise.
