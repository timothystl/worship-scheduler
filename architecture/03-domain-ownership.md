## Key domain rules

### Website versus Connect

The Website presents the digital contact card and prayer form. Connect owns the resulting private follow-up and prayer records. Website editors control presentation, not pastoral workflow data.

### Giving versus Finance

Connect owns every individual giving transaction. Finance consumes a versioned summary containing totals by period/fund, household counts/bands where authorized, generation time, and source version. Finance cannot directly mutate Giving tables.

### Facilities versus Finance

Facilities owns the request, booking, work order, provider, quote, repair, warranty, document, and completion status. Finance owns accounting classification, budget effect, payment/reconciliation, and financial reporting.

### HR, myMDO, and Payroll

- Church HR owns employment identity, employment terms, official policy, benefits eligibility, and formal HR records.
- myMDO owns classroom work, schedules, clocking, MDO PTO workflow, childcare credentials, and director approval.
- Finance owns payroll preparation, gross calculations, deductions/allowances, close state, provider export, and reconciliation.

### Reporting

Each product owns its reports. Cross-product reporting uses read-only projections with documented definitions; it does not directly join production databases.
