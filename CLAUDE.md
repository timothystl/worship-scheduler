## What This App Is

Church Management System (ChMS) for Timothy Lutheran Church. Built on **Cloudflare Workers + D1 (SQLite)**. Single-page app served from `src/html-chms.js` (renders as one large HTML string). API routes live in `src/api-chms.js` (people, giving, households, dashboard) and `src/api-admin.js` (auth, users, scheduler).

**Live at:** `https://[subdomain].timothystl.org/chms`

## Architecture Notes

- **Auth**: Cookie-based HMAC-SHA256. Login checks `app_users` table first (per-user DB accounts), falls back to `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env-var for break-glass admin access only.
- **Roles**: `admin | finance | staff | member` — enforced per endpoint in both API files.
- **Photos**: Stored in R2 bucket `tlc-chms-photos`; served via `/admin/r2photo/` proxy.
- **Breeze ChMS sync**: `POST /admin/api/import/breeze` (bulk) and `POST /admin/api/import/breeze-sync-person` (per-person). See NOTES.md for field ID quirks.
- **D1 param limit**: ~100 per statement. Use chunked queries for large IN/NOT IN lists.

## Queued Items (add new ones here during sessions)

<!-- Add items here as they come up. Format: - [ ] Description (noted YYYY-MM-DD) -->

### People List
- [ ] **PL1** — Revisit how the people list is divided: user primarily works with members but doesn't want to discard other contacts. Think through a better default view / filter strategy. Needs design conversation first. (noted 2026-04-17)
- [x] **PL2** — Archive/Deceased people: `status` column (`active|archived|deceased`) added; archived/deceased hidden from default list; "Archived" toggle button in toolbar; Archive/Deceased/Reactivate buttons on profile; anniversary cards exclude deceased. Done 2026-04-20 (v81).

### Giving / Finance
- [x] **G1** — Fund import: pre-fetches `/api/funds` from Breeze to resolve real names; retroactively renames any "Breeze Fund XXXXX" placeholders on next sync. Done 2026-04-17.
- [x] **G2** — Edit individual gifts from person profile: click batch number → opens that batch; click a gift row → modal to edit that individual gift (amount, fund, date, method, check #, note). Done 2026-04-17 (v27).
- [ ] **G3** — Overall gift entry workflow improvements (user has more detail — revisit in dedicated session). (noted 2026-04-17)
- [x] **G9** — Late-entry contributions: 45-day grace window added to sync — Dec contributions logged in Jan are now imported with their actual Dec contribution date. seenIds guard prevents double-import. Audit log limit raised to 10000. Done 2026-04-19 (v71).
- [x] **G4** — Reopen batch button is broken/dead — fixed 2026-04-17 (v37).
- [x] **G5** — Export data: persons, giving (year-by-year), and register data. Done 2026-04-17 (v38).
- [x] **G6** — Giving CSV import reconciliation fixes (v47, v51, 2026-04-17): (1) Negative entries (refunds/adjustments) were silently dropped — fixed. (2) "nan" fund name (blank exported by Excel) now maps to General Fund. (3) Float person IDs (`43826663.0`) now stripped. (4) Split-fund multi-row payments: Breeze exports one row per fund with same Payment ID; second row was treated as duplicate and fund allocation dropped — fixed with nth-occurrence tracking. Import now shows expandable list of skipped payment IDs as diagnostic.
- [x] **G7** — Giving by Fund report now groups funds by numeric code prefix (e.g., all "40085 *" variants under one collapsible group with subtotal). Done 2026-04-17 (v48).
- [x] **G8** — Re-import all giving years (2022–2026) after G6 fixes. Completed 2026-04-17 — all years 2021–2026 verified correct.
- [ ] **G10** — Correction pass bug (correctedCount always 0): `contribution_updated` audit events reference a NEW/DIFFERENT payment ID than the original `contribution_added` event for the same contribution (e.g. Anne Gonzalez added as 489967480, updated event references 489967631). The v76 correction pass does `SELECT ... WHERE breeze_id IN (updatedPaymentIds)` but those IDs are never in the DB — so corrections never apply. Fix: rewrite to match by `(breeze_person_id + contribution_date)` from the update event, OR do a full reconciliation pass iterating all `glByPaymentId` entries against DB by breeze_id and comparing amounts. (noted 2026-04-19)
- [ ] **G11** — Wrong-amount DB entries to manually verify and correct (decimal-omission pattern — amount entered without decimal in Breeze, stored as 100× too large): (1) Anne Gonzalez: Mar 2 2025, breeze_id=489967480 — DB likely ~$47,000, should be $47.00. (2) Pat Hunt: Sep 14 2025, breeze_id=502910208 — DB likely ~$100,000, should be $100.00. (3) Horst Herrmann: Dec 7 2025, breeze_id=508741044 — DB likely ~$900,000, should be $900.00. (4) John Hagan: Dec 7 2025, breeze_id=508740979 — DB likely ~$50,000, should be $50.00. Use Edit Gift modal to correct each. (noted 2026-04-19)
- [ ] **G12** — Wrong-fund DB entry to verify and correct: Leah Sieveking Nov 2 2025, breeze_id=505718823 — audit log shows fund changed from Noah Comfort Dog (1718222) to General Fund (1718214). DB likely still has old fund. Use Edit Gift modal to correct. (noted 2026-04-19)
- [ ] **G13** — Ghost fund 1771128 → General Fund (1718214): Code fix added in v77 (hardcoded redirect + migration pass on sync). After running next sync, verify Sue Koch (Apr 27 2025, breeze_id=495182958, $40) and Thanh Nguyen (Feb 22 2026, breeze_id=512469513, $25) both show General Fund. User edited these in Breeze on 2026-04-19, which likely created new payment IDs — after sync, check for duplicate entries by person+date and delete old ones via Edit Gift modal if needed. (noted 2026-04-19)
- [ ] **G14** — $68.43 fund-change test: User changed the Feb 9 2025 $68.43 gift in Breeze from "Other" to "General Fund" on 2026-04-19. Audit log confirmed new payment ID 514675972 was created; old entry breeze_id=488482959 still in DB. On next sync: expect old entry 488482959 removed by dedup pass and new entry 514675972 added with General Fund. Run 2025 or 2025-2026 sync to verify. (noted 2026-04-19)
- [ ] **G15** — Ron Rall split to verify: May 25 2025, audit log shows `contribution_updated` with split change to $3,735.45 General Fund + $1,500 PNG Mission Fund (total $5,235.45). Confirm DB has correct split amounts and both funds. (noted 2026-04-19)
- [ ] **G16** — Kathy Carr fund change to verify: Feb 2 2025, audit log shows update to TUB Bees fund (1718237). Confirm DB has correct fund for her Feb 2 2025 contribution. (noted 2026-04-19)

### Dashboard
- [x] **DB5** — Last worship card: show both services AND the combined total on a single card (not two separate cards). Done 2026-04-17 (v27).
- [x] **DB6** — Dashboard customization: ability to add, remove, and reorder/move cards on the dashboard. Done 2026-04-20 (v79) — show/hide cards via "⚙ Customize" button; preferences in localStorage.
- [x] **DB7** — Anniversary dashboard spouse pairing misses some households — fixed 2026-04-17 (v42). Secondary household lookup finds partner when only one spouse has anniversary_date set.
- [x] **DB8** — Anniversary pairing: further fixes 2026-04-17 (v49, v50). (v49) Secondary lookup broadened beyond head/spouse family_role. (v50) Removed member_type filter from secondary lookup — common pattern is one member + one visitor spouse; visitor was excluded and partner showed solo.

### Households / Data Quality
- [x] **HQ4** — Household head robustness scan: Settings card shows count of headless households; "Fix Household Heads" promotes spouse or first member. API: GET /admin/api/households/no-head-count and POST /admin/api/households/fix-heads. Done 2026-04-17 (v46).

### Photos
- [x] **PH1** — Household picture: upload photo for a household via hh-modal upload button → R2 → DB. Done 2026-04-17 (v46).
- [x] **PH2** — Crop profile picture: add a crop/resize tool when uploading a profile photo. Done 2026-04-20 (v79).
- [x] **PH3** — Black bar appearing above some household cards — fixed 2026-04-17 (v45). Wrapped photo img in a container div with background:var(--linen); onerror hides the whole container.

### People / Filters
- [x] **PF1** — Filter people by missing data fields: checkboxes organized by category with AND logic. Done 2026-04-17 (v46).

### Attendance / Reports
- [x] **AT1** — Attendance table collapse/expand toggle. Done 2026-04-17 (v46).
- [x] **AT2** — Attendance graph direction fixed: ORDER BY ASC so oldest dates plot left. Done 2026-04-17 (v46).
- [x] **AT3** — Attendance graphs: drag to resize charts. Done 2026-04-20 (v79).
- [x] **AT4** — Year-over-year giving/attendance report: overlapping graphs to compare current year vs prior year on the same chart. Done 2026-04-20 (v79) — Giving Trend tile in Reports tab; YoY attendance was already implemented.

### Communications / Email
- [ ] **EM1** — Connect member email list to the newsletter the church sends out (integrate or export for mailing). Requires email infrastructure (Resend or similar). (noted 2026-04-17)
- [ ] **EM2** — Automated birthday/anniversary emails: automatically send a "Happy Birthday" or "Happy Anniversary" email to members on their day. Requires email infrastructure. (noted 2026-04-17)

### Scheduler
- [ ] **SC1** — Make the scheduler native to the CHMS app instead of linking out to an external scheduler. Large, unknown scope — needs scoping session. (noted 2026-04-17) — see Phase 6 N2.

### Breeze Integration
- [ ] **BR1** — Reverse sync (app → Breeze): Breeze API supports write operations (add/update people, add contributions). Feasible for narrow workflows (e.g. new person entered here → push to Breeze, or walk-in gift batch → push to Breeze). Full bidirectional sync is complex due to conflict resolution. Needs scoping conversation: which specific data entry workflows would benefit? (noted 2026-04-19)

## Code Review Standards

Before finalizing any code in this project, perform a structured five-pass review:

**Pass 1 — Logic & Bugs**
Check that every function does what its name says. Look for edge cases:
null/undefined values, empty inputs, unexpected data types, non-exhaustive
conditionals. Trace the logic path for failure scenarios, not just happy paths.

**Pass 2 — Privacy & Security**
Flag any exposed secrets, API keys, or credentials. Check that user input is
validated before use. Ensure personal data (names, contact info, financial
records) is handled with intentional access control. Never log sensitive data.

**Pass 3 — Performance**
Identify loops inside loops, unnecessary re-renders, unthrottled/undebounced
event handlers, synchronous operations that should be async, and repeated
data fetches that could be cached or combined.

**Pass 4 — Efficiency & Clarity**
Remove redundant variables and duplicate logic. Extract repeated patterns into
helper functions. Simplify overly complex conditionals. Code should read like
clear prose — if a line requires re-reading, rewrite it.

**Pass 5 — Dead Code & Cleanup**
Remove commented-out code, unused imports, leftover console.log statements,
and completed TODO comments. Leave no debugging artifacts in production code.

After each session, summarize what changed and why — treat this as a commit
message for future reference.

## Daily Code Review Checklist

Run through this at the end of any session before pushing, or at the start of a session when picking up from someone else.

### Security
- [ ] Every new API endpoint checks role (`isAdmin`, `isFinance`, `isStaff`, `canEdit`) before doing anything
- [ ] No raw user input passed into SQL — always use `.bind()` parameterized queries
- [ ] HTML output always runs through `esc()` — never concatenate raw user data into innerHTML
- [ ] No secrets or API keys hardcoded — all from `env.*` (Cloudflare secrets)
- [ ] New endpoints that touch giving data are gated behind `isFinance`

### Cloudflare Worker Limits
- [ ] No single DB query uses more than ~90 parameters in an IN/NOT IN — chunk if needed
- [ ] Any loop that does per-row DB queries is replaced with a bulk SELECT + JS grouping (avoid 30s timeouts)
- [ ] Large import/sync operations return early with `done: true` and let the frontend re-trigger if needed

### API Correctness
- [ ] New endpoints return `json({ error: '...' }, 4xx)` on bad input, not a 200 with an error field
- [ ] All new endpoints are wrapped in try/catch so uncaught exceptions return JSON, not Cloudflare's HTML error page
- [ ] New routes added to the correct file (`api-chms.js` for ChMS data, `api-admin.js` for auth/users/scheduler)

### Frontend Consistency
- [ ] New API calls use `api('/admin/api/...')` wrapper, not raw `fetch()`
- [ ] New modals have a unique ID and use `openModal(id)` / `closeModal(id)`
- [ ] `DEPLOY_VERSION` bumped in `html-chms.js` on every commit that changes the frontend
- [ ] New tabs added to `showTab()` labels map and trigger their load function

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Any query returning a household name uses COALESCE fallback for `head_first_name` (not all members have `family_role='head'`)
- [ ] Giving amounts stored and retrieved as **integer cents**, converted to dollars only at display time (`/ 100`)
- [ ] New person/household fields default to `''` (empty string) not NULL where possible — avoids COALESCE boilerplate everywhere

### Before Every Push
- [ ] `DEPLOY_VERSION` is bumped
- [ ] `NOTES.md` Recent Changes has an entry for this version
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` Queued Items updated — new items added, completed items checked off
- [ ] Pushed to `claude/continue-volunteer-app-xhY9J`, not main

---

## Gotchas & Patterns

- `disambiguateHHName(name, headFirst)` — shared helper at top of `api-chms.js`. Always use COALESCE fallback in `head_first_name` subqueries (not all members have `family_role='head'`).
- **Breeze giving CSV format quirks**: (1) Split-fund donations appear as multiple rows with the same Payment ID (one row per fund). The importer handles this with nth-occurrence tracking (`pid`, `pid-2`, `pid-3`). (2) Sub-fund names like "40085 Christmas Offering" are stored as separate fund records — they are NOT rolled into "40085 General Fund". The Giving by Fund report groups them by numeric prefix. (3) Negative entries are valid (refunds/adjustments) and are imported. (4) "nan" fund name = blank field from Excel export → maps to General Fund. (5) Person IDs may have `.0` float suffix — stripped on import.
- **Anniversary secondary lookup**: only requires `active=1` and non-deceased — does NOT filter by `family_role` or `member_type`, since the qualifying person already passed those checks and their partner may be a visitor or have no role set.
- Dashboard birthday/anniversary: two separate cards since v23. Copy functions: `dashCopyBirthdays()` / `dashCopyAnniversaries()`. Anniversary rows are couple-paired by household+date in the API before returning.
- `api()` helper in frontend handles 401→redirect. Always use it instead of raw `fetch` for `/admin/api/*` calls.
- All modals have specific IDs (e.g. `person-modal`, `hh-modal`). There is no generic `modal-overlay`. Use `openModal(id)` / `closeModal(id)`.
- DEPLOY_VERSION is at the top of the `<script>` block in `html-chms.js`. Bump it on every commit.
